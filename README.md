# Nicolò Lai 
## Undergraduate Physics Student

### Hi there! :smiley: Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### :point_right: Basic informations:
I was born
* on April 30th, 1999 
* in Treviso (TV), Italy

Currently living in 
* Padua (PD), Italy

### :zap: Briefly:

Undergraduate physics student, graduating in December 2021. 

Strong interest and skills in data science and statistics applied to both physics and finance.

Eye for detail.

### :mortar_board: What the B.Sc. in Physics taught me:

The bachelor's degree has formed my skills in advanced physics, mathematics and statistics. In addition, it has allowed
me to acquire a mindset aimed at solving a wide range of complicated problems by exploiting different skills at the same
time. I have also developed the ability to work in a team and to write reports or scientific articles.

My final dissertation, titled ["Predictive Learning Applied to Muon Chamber
Monitoring"](https://github.com/niklai99/PredictiveLearning_applied_to_MuonChamberMonitoring) (link to the GitHub
repository), exploits neural networks to monitor the correct functioning of the detector over time by comparing the data
stream with a reference dataset.

### :boom: Cool Stuff on my GitHub:

* Computational physics project: deriving, solving and visualizing the triple pendulum equations of motion numerically
  through iterative methods and animations:
