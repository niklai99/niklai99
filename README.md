## Undergraduate Physics Student

### Hi there :mortar_board:
I was born
* on April 30th, 1999 
* in Treviso (TV), Italy

### Briefly:

I'm an undergraduate physics student, currently attending the University of Padua. During the years of studies I developed a strong interest in data analysis, and data science more generally, thanks to physics experiments carried out in the laboratory, statistics courses, and most of all to data analysis work done by some professors at LHC (CERN).
