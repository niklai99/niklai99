## :mortar_board: M.Sc. in Physics of Data @ UniPd

The Physics of Data master's degree program provides me with the opportunity to enhance my machine learning and data analysis skills as I advance my career in particle physics. This program adopts a project-based approach, which allows me to gain both a theoretical understanding and practical experience in applying data science tools to high energy physics problems. In addition, it provides a solid foundation to support my research journey in this field.

## :mortar_board: B.Sc. in Physics @ UniPd:

The Bachelor's degree in Physics has helped me to develop a strong foundation in physics, mathematics, and statistics. Furthermore, it has instilled in me a problem-solving mindset, enabling me to tackle complex challenges effectively by utilizing my skills in multiple disciplines simultaneously.

## :boom: Recent projects:

* ### Real-time data quality monitoring using kernel methods and GPU computing
  
  #### (Jan 2023 - In progress)

  In my current research project, I am building upon my previous work in the field of data quality monitoring. This project is a direct follow-up of the "Predictive learning applied to muon chamber monitoring" project, the NeurIPS 2022 poster presentation of  "A fast and flexible machine learning approach to data quality monitoring" and the published paper "Fast kernel methods for Data Quality Monitoring as a goodness-of-fit test". I am now working to deploy a real-time data quality monitoring procedure using kernel methods and GPU computing, as an extension of my previous work. By switching from traditional neural networks to kernel methods, I have been able to significantly reduce the training time, making it possible to monitor data in real-time. Additionally, I am investigating ways to perform preprocessing tasks on the GPU in order to further scale down the processing time. The goal of this research is to create an online monitoring system that can identify and flag potential anomalies in data, without any preconceived notions about what those anomalies might be. I have been testing the algorithm using the small-scale replica of the CMS drift tubes detector at the INFN Legnaro National Laboratories together with the 40 MHz data acquisition electronics prototypes. 

* ### [Unsupervised Multi-class Jet Tagging using Convolutional Graph Autoencoders](https://github.com/niklai99/jet-tagging)
  
  #### (Jan 2023 - Feb 2023)
  
  The goal of this project is to improve the unsupervised multi-class classification of jets in high-energy physics experiments using a modified architecture of the existing state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on graph convolutional autoencoder. The current conventional machine learning techniques for jet physics suffer from limitations in terms of bias and generalization because they rely on simulated events for training. Hence, the proposed model utilizes the particle cloud representation of jets to overcome these limitations.
The proposed model's results are promising, providing insights into the potential for applying convolutional graph autoencoders for unsupervised multi-class jet tagging. Although the model lags behind state-of-the-art unsupervised multi-class classification models, the study's results pave the way for further research in this area.

* ### [Energy reconstruction in JUNO with classical and quantum machine learning methods](https://github.com/niklai99/qcnn4juno) 
  
  #### (Mar 2022 - Jun 2022)
  
  I worked with a team to explore advanced machine learning techniques for energy reconstruction in the JUNO collaboration. We focused on using state-of-the-art residual network models to accurately and efficiently reconstruct the energy of simulated neutrino events. By using these models, we improved the performance of energy reconstruction algorithms, thereby enhancing the capabilities of the JUNO detector. Additionally, we explored the use of quantum machine learning techniques to improve the performance of the algorithms further. 

* ### [Distributed processing of JUNO datasets for improved energy reconstruction](https://github.com/niklai99/distributed-juno) 
  
    #### (May 2022 - Jul 2022)
  
   I worked with my team to build a novel data preprocessing pipeline for improved energy reconstruction in the JUNO collaboration. By addressing the dataset scalability issue, we have improved the accuracy of state-of-the-art residual network models in reconstructing the energy of simulated neutrino events. The pipeline is specifically designed to make the data easier to feed into a large residual network, thereby speeding up the training and prediction processes while maintaining sufficient information in the data.

* ### [Predictive learning applied to muon chamber monitoring](https://github.com/niklai99/BSc-thesis-NNs4DQM) 
  
  #### (Jul 2021 - Dec 2021)
  
  I developed a data quality monitoring procedure using deep neural networks to detect and identify any anomalies in a batch of data, indicating detector malfunction. I adapted traditional hypothesis testing and goodness of fit techniques for a more flexible approach and tested the algorithm using a small-scale replica of a CMS drift tubes detector. This improved the accuracy and reliability of data produced by the detector and has the potential to enhance performance monitoring and maintenance in similar high-energy physics experiments.
