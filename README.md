### Hi there :mortar_board:


I'm an undergraduate physics student, currently attending the University of Padua. During the years of studies I developed a strong interest in data
analysis, and data science more generally, thanks to physics experiments carried out in the laboratory, statistics courses, and most of all to data
analysis work done by some professors at LHC (CERN).
